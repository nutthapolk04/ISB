## 2. User Roles & Access Control

| Role | Module Access | Restrictions |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Admin** | All modules + Shop Management + Reports + Family/Topup admin | None — cross-module |
| **Manager** | POS, Receipts, Returns, Void, Shop Management (own shop only) | Scoped to assigned shop |
| **Cashier** | POS, Receipts | Scoped to assigned shop |
| **Parent** | Parent Portal (`/parent/*`) only | Linked children's wallets only |
| **Staff** | Parent Portal (own wallet) | Same as parent, no POS |

### Module Architecture

Shops are grouped into two independent modules, enforced by `RequireModule` guard:

| Module | shopId prefix | Shops |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| `canteen` | `canteen`, `canteen_*` | ISB Canteen, Thai Kitchen, Drinks & Snacks |
| `store` | everything else | Coop Shop, Sports Shop, Bookstore |

`user.shopModule` is stored at login (authoritative from `shops.module` column, fallback via `moduleOf(shopId)` prefix convention).

### Route Access Matrix

## 5. Module Specifications

### Module 1: Authentication ✅

| Feature | Description | API |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Login | JWT token via username/password | `POST /auth/login` |
| Profile | Get current user info | `GET /auth/me` |
| Register | Admin creates new user account | `POST /auth/register` |
| List Users | View all user accounts | `GET /auth/users` |
| Logout | Client-side token invalidation | `POST /auth/logout` |
| Fallback | If backend unreachable, mock login for demo | — |

**Token Flow:**
1. `POST /auth/login` → returns `access_token` + `refresh_token`
2. Token stored in `localStorage("access_token")`
3. All API calls include `Authorization: Bearer {token}`

---

### Module 2: Shop Management ✅

| Feature | Description | API |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| List Shops | 2-tab view: 🍜 Canteens / 🏪 Retail — card grid per module | `GET /shops/?active_only=true` |
| Shop Stats | Total products (always); low stock count + total value (store module only) | `GET /shops/{id}/stats` |
| Create Shop | Specify ID, name, description, costing type, module | `POST /shops/` |
| Edit Shop | Update name, description, active status | `PATCH /shops/{id}` |
| Delete Shop | Hard delete if no receipts; soft delete (is_active=false) if has receipts | `DELETE /shops/{id}` |
| Shop Module | `module` column on shops (`canteen` or `store`) drives module routing + stock semantics | — |

**Shop Types** (store module only — canteen ignores costing):

- `avg_cost` — Weighted average cost recalculation on receive
- `fifo` — First-In First-Out lot tracking

**Shop Modules:**

- `canteen` — Canteen POS routes (`/canteen/*`); menu-oriented UI; **no stock or cost tracking** — items are made-to-order, not stocked. Costing-type badge is hidden on the shop card.
- `store` — Store POS routes (`/store/*`); inventory + returns UI; full stock/movement/FIFO tracking

---

### Module 3: Inventory Management ✅ (store module only)

> **Canteen note:** canteen shops have menu CRUD only — `Stock Receive`, `Stock Adjust`, `Movement History`, and `FIFO Lots` are not surfaced in the canteen UI and seed sets `stock = 0` / `avg_cost = 0` for every canteen item.

| Feature | Description | Scope | API |
|---------|-------------|-------|-----|
| List Products | Per-shop products with search, category filter | both | `GET /shops/{id}/products` |
| Create Product | Code, barcode, name, category, dual pricing, VAT, initial stock | both (canteen ignores stock fields) | `POST /shops/{id}/products` |
| Edit Product | Update product details (not stock directly) | both | `PATCH /shops/{id}/products/{pid}` |
| Delete Product | Soft delete | both | `DELETE /shops/{id}/products/{pid}` |
| Categories CRUD | Per-shop product categories | both | `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /shops/{id}/categories` |
| Stock Receive | Batch receive with cost per unit | store only | `POST /shops/{id}/receive` |
| Stock Adjust | Manual adjustment with reason | store only | `POST /shops/{id}/adjust` |
| Movement History | View all stock movements | store only | `GET /shops/{id}/movements` |
| FIFO Lots | View lot details for FIFO shops | store only | `GET /shops/{id}/products/{pid}/fifo-lots` |

**Product Fields:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `product_code` | Unique code per shop (e.g. P001) |
| `barcode` | EAN-13 or custom barcode |
| `name` | Product display name |
| `category` | Category name (from shop categories) |
| `external_price` | Retail price (public) |
| `internal_price` | Internal/staff price |
| `vat_percent` | VAT percentage (0 or 7) |
| `avg_cost` | Calculated cost (auto for avg_cost, from lots for FIFO) |
| `stock` | Current stock quantity (negative allowed) |
| `min_stock` | Low stock threshold |

**Costing Logic:**
- **Avg Cost shops:** `new_avg = (current_qty * current_avg + new_qty * new_cost) / (current_qty + new_qty)`
- **FIFO shops:** Each receive creates a lot; deductions consume oldest lots first; phantom lot for negative stock

---

### Module 4: POS Checkout ✅

| Feature | Description | API |

    { "product_variant_id": 1, "quantity": 2, "unit_price": 5.00, "discount": 0 }
  ],
  "notes": "optional"
}
```

**Response:** Receipt object with `receipt_number` (format: `R-YYYYMMDD-NNN`)

**Topup Flow (Parent Self-Confirm):**
1. Parent enters amount → `POST /wallets/{id}/topup` → QR dialog opens
2. Parent scans QR with bank app, transfers money
3. Parent clicks "ยืนยันการโอน" → `POST /wallets/topup/{ref_code}/parent-confirm`

---

### Module 16: Topup Flow — Auto-Confirm (Phase 2.1)

> **Removed:** the previous `/admin/topups` confirmation page and admin manual-confirmation endpoints. Topups are now semi-automatic: parent generates a QR intent, pays externally, and the parent app calls `parent-confirm` which credits the wallet immediately. No admin gating.

| Feature | Description | Route/API |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Create QR Intent | Parent generates a top-up reference + PromptPay payload | `POST /wallets/{wallet_id}/topup` |
| Parent Confirm | After paying, parent app calls confirm → wallet credited; `confirmed_via=parent_self` recorded for audit | `POST /wallets/topup/{ref_code}/parent-confirm` |
| Family Link Admin | Admin manages parent-child links | `/admin/families` |

**Audit trail:** `payment_intents.status` / `confirmed_at` / `confirmed_by` / `confirmed_via` columns retained for history. `WalletTransaction` rows are still written on each credit.

- Wallet balance in receipt = `balance_after` at time of purchase (not current balance)
- Used in both Admin dashboard and Parent transaction history

## 8. Known Limitations

| Area | Limitation |
|------|-----------|
| **Employee-Shop relation** | Employee management scoped to shop via backend `shop_id` column on users |
| **Permission enforcement** | Backend `check_permission()` is a stub — all authenticated users pass |
| **Card/Payment verification** | All payment methods are simulated (no real card reader or payment gateway) |
| **Reports** | UI only, no backend data aggregation |
| **Receipt PDF** | Download button exists but no PDF generation |
| **Pagination** | Most list endpoints load all records |
| **Refresh token** | Token exists but rotation flow not implemented |
| **Department charge** | Requires shop to have `allow_department_charge=true` |
| **Receipt PDF download** | Button exists, not yet implemented |
| **PowerSchool sync** | Fixture-based (demo only, no live API) |
